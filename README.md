# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**. 
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![](images/diagram.JPG)                                      |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | The musician will send the UDP datagrams over the 9904 port every second. |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | The auditor will listen on that same port (9904) and receive those datagrams and update its list of musician. |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | A payload consisting of the uuid of the musician aswell as the sound it is emitting with its instrument and the last time it played music. |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | I used a map to store instruments with their sounds. <br />Both the musician and the auditor will have this map.<br />On the musician side I use this map to get the sound that is playing in order to send it to the auditor.<br />On the auditor side I use this map to get the instrument played by the musician by using the sound it receives from the musician. |


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
| | JSON.stringify(object) |
|Question | What is **npm**?  |
| | It's a package manager for Node.JS that helps dealing with dependencies by using the package.json file. |
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?  |
| | It installs all the packages and dependencies in the node_modules folder.<br />The  `--save` option is deprecated since version 5.0.0 of npm, it was used to save the installed packages in the dependencies of the package.json file. |
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?  |
| | It's a database of packages for npm. We can use it to find useful packages. |
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
| | We need to include the uuid package in our code with this line : <br />`const {v4: uuidv4} = require ('uuid')`<br />Then we need to generate the UUID with : `uuidv4 ();` |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
| | setInterval(function, timeInMiliseconds); |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**? |
| | We need to include the dgram package : `const dgram = require('dgram');`<br />Then we create a socket : `const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');`<br />And finally we can emit our datagram with :<br /> `socket.send(msg, 0, msg.length, UDP_PORT, MULTICAST);` |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
| | We can access the command line arguments by using this : <br />`process.argv[n]` with `n` being the **n**th argument |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?|
| | `docker build -t res/musician ./pathToDockerfile`<br />Where `res/musician` is the name of the image |
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?  |
| | `ENTRYPOINT` defines a list of command that will be executed when we start our container<br />Here the command entered will be : `node musician.js ` |
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?  |
| | `docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/musician INSTRUMENT`<br />by adding an instrument at the end of our run command, we give a parameter to our container which will be used at the start, thus the **EXACT** command used on start up will be : `node musician.js INSTRUMENT` which is exactly what we want, we can now give an instrument to our musician! |
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?  |
| | `docker ps`                                                  |
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?  |
| | `docker stop NAME`<br />`docker kill NAME`<br />Where NAME is their the NAME of the container. |
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?  |
| | By using a network sniffer, we can see packets being received and delivered |


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | ---  |
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
| | Once we have our udp socket, we can use the `addMembership` function to add it to a multicast group using a multicast ip address. |
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?  |
| | A map store elements following a Key/Value pair, we can use it to create a "dictionnary" of instruments and sounds. <br />I also use it to store musicians. |
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?  |
| | Moment.js is used to retrieve the exact value of the current date and to do operations on dates, like computing the time difference between two dates. |
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?  |
| | If a musician isn't playing for more than 5 seconds, then it gets removed from the list of active musicians. |
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?  |
| | Through the net module we can create a TCP server using :<br />`const server = net.createServer()` function.<br /> We can also add a listening port to the server with `server.listen(TCP_PORT)` |


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
| | First by using the `validate.sh` script given. Once it passed all test we can simply run an auditor with multiple musicians and observe payload being sent when connecting with telnet. |


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
